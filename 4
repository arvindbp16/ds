Explanation:
1. Mean (Average)
    • What it is: The mean is what we usually call the average. It tells us what the "typical" number is when we have a bunch of numbers.
    • How to find it: To find the mean, we add up all the numbers and then divide by how many numbers there are.
    • Example: If you have 2 candies, 3 candies, and 5 candies, you first add them up (2 + 3 + 5 = 10) and then divide by how many groups of candies there are (3). So, the mean is 10÷3=3.3310 ÷ 3 = 3.3310÷3=3.33.
2. Median
    • What it is: The median is the middle number in a list of numbers. If we lined up all our numbers from smallest to largest, the median would be the one right in the middle.
    • How to find it: If there’s an odd number of numbers, the median is the one in the middle. If there’s an even number, we take the two middle numbers, add them together, and divide by 2.
    • Example: For the numbers 2, 3, 5, the median is 3. For 2, 3, 4, 5, the median is (3+4)÷2=3.5 (3 + 4) ÷ 2 = 3.5(3+4)÷2=3.5.
3. Mode
    • What it is: The mode is the number that appears the most in a list. It tells us which number is the most popular.
    • How to find it: We look at our list of numbers and see which one shows up the most times.
    • Example: If you have candies like this: 2, 2, 3, 4, the mode is 2 because it appears more times than any other number.
4. Variance
    • What it is: Variance tells us how spread out the numbers are. If the numbers are all close to the mean, the variance is small. If they’re very different from each other, the variance is big.
    • How to find it: We calculate how far each number is from the mean, square those differences, and then average them.
    • Example: If the numbers are 2, 3, and 4, they are all close to the mean (3), so the variance is small. If the numbers are 1, 5, and 10, they are more spread out, so the variance is larger.
5. Standard Deviation
    • What it is: Standard deviation is just a fancy word for how much the numbers vary from the mean. It’s like the square root of the variance.
    • How to find it: We take the square root of the variance.
    • Example: If the variance tells us how far apart the candies are from the average size, the standard deviation gives us a way to understand that distance in the same units as the candies.
6. Mean Deviation
    • What it is: Mean deviation tells us, on average, how far each number is from the mean. It helps us see how different the numbers are from the average number.
    • How to find it: We take the absolute value of the differences between each number and the mean, and then find the average of those differences.
    • Example: If the mean is 3 and the numbers are 2, 3, and 4, the distances from the mean are 1 (for 2), 0 (for 3), and 1 (for 4). The mean deviation would be (1+0+1)÷3=0.67 (1 + 0 + 1) ÷ 3 = 0.67(1+0+1)÷3=0.67.
7. Quartile Deviation
    • What it is: Quartile deviation measures how spread out the middle half of the data is. It uses the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) to find the "interquartile range."
    • How to find it: We first find Q1 and Q3, then subtract Q1 from Q3, and divide by 2.
    • Example: If Q1 is 2 and Q3 is 4, the quartile deviation is (4−2)÷2=1 (4 - 2) ÷ 2 = 1(4−2)÷2=1. This means the middle half of the candies is spread out over 1 candy.
